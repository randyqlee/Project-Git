1.  Need to cap the damage to 0.  Negative damage should not be applicable.
2.  Prposed solution for 2a and 2b:  Values check before apply damage in TakeDamage function.  If attack and/or armor is negative, cap to zero.
    2a.  Need a solution for Negative attacks.  Scenario is crippled strike and Decrease Attack Debuffs.
    2b.  Need a soluton for Negative armor, for stacking effects (though there should be none)
